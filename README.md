# Means


Are you living beyond your means? Do you need help managing your finances? Means is here for you. 

Means offers you a simple dashboard for seeing your finances at a glance - it:

- Shows you how much money you are saving or losing every day
- Allows you to see if your spending habits are sustainable with your income
- Normalizes your expenses per day so you can easily compare them - are you spending more on Starbucks or your rent?
- Gives you tips on how to cut corners (or make some extra cash) if you are living beyond your means
- Gives you tips on how to make the best use of your excess money if you are accumulating it on your spending account

Demo:
